The server and a client can be open sourced (GPL3).
We can make money on:
1. provide a client hardware card, offloading the computation, higher throughput.
2. admin UI, gives a point and click interface. Provides health graphs
3. cross data centers replication. The internet connection can be lossy and route are unknown.
   Going with UDP across might require us do more work, we should consider TCP
