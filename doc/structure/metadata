Metadata should describe 
 - latest version of a file
 - permissions
 - versions of data blocks of a file
 - file size
 - create, modify, access times
 - file type ?

  metadata for a file should be stored as a tree where each data block hash is a node.
We should have a checksum of each edge, the checksum of all edges represents a current version of a file.
when the branch occurs we shold (could) follow a git model and create a merge object. Merge object 
is a collection of nodes with the same parent.
