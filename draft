content packet

	location hash
	parent content hash - the digest of the content that when we opened a file
	content chunk id
	content chunk parent hash
	content chunk hash
	content data


when server receives the content packet
  1. writes it into a journal log
  2. if parent hash and current data hash match then it apply the data to the target file
	and updates the current hash
  3. if parent hash does not match then the data remains in the journal
	host should contact neighboring host to get the missing content chunk(s)
  4. if content chunk applied cleanly the the target file, the entry should be remove from a journal



Hashing
  1. each filesystem has its own hash seed.
	hash seed is set during configuration
	it can be changed but the entire filesystem tree needs tbe re-checked.


Deduplication
  1. store hash of a data block

P2P for clients on the same network???
